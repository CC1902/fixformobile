			<h4>Voice based communication</h4>
			<div class="sectionp1">The internet can be used for voice communication.</div> 
			
			<h5> Audio Conferencing:</h5> 
			<p>Via applications such as Skype or AOL. The  user requires a microphone, a speaker or headphones, to communicate with a  connection between two devices. This form essentially mimics the traditional  phone call.</p>
         
			<h5>Video Conferencing </h5>
         <p>Via applications Zoom, Fuse or Teams. Here the user requires  a webcam to present themselves in video format. This helps build rapport with  new clients or students as the visual field helps build rapport. Non-verbal  communication can assist in helping an educator as visible frustration or  confusion can add to the cues available over a silent response on a traditional  phone call. This format mimics a television broadcast with numerous cameras  available to portray different speakers when they speak.</p>
         
			<h5>VoIP (Video over Internet Protocols) </h5>
          <p>Is essentially a phone service provided via an internet  connection. Users are given a unique number and can then make outgoing calls  and incoming calls. WhatsApp provides a VoIP element in their application,  however a proper VoIP system does not require another phone to use an  application or even be online themselves. Although such calls routinely incur a  charge, unlike the charge free services when both users are on an application  like WhatsApp.</p>

        <h4>Written communication</h4>
        <div class="sectionp1">Electronic Mail, Instant Messaging, Internet Relay Chat,<br> Short  Message Services &amp; Wireless Communications</div>
        
			
			<h5>E-mail</h5>
        <p>A means of communicating where transmission of messages  occurs over communications networks. E-mails can be simply written by the  sender to the recipient via their email address, or they can contain files such as  publications attached liked PowerPoint, Excel or Word documents. Video, audio  and image files can also be attached into emails. Typically one acquires their  email address from a provider and then use this application to send and receive  emails. G-mail, Outlook &amp; Yahoo-mail are some of the more commonly used email  services. When working in larger groups emails can be sent to individuals  within the group or to the entirety of the group. E-mail does present a  security risk where unrecognised emails arrive into your inbox. Anti-virus  software can be used against this risk. More commonly people are advised not to  open emails from unrecognised sources and never to open links in such emails. </p>
			
        <h5>Instant Messaging</h5>
        <p>Instant messaging (IM) is a text based communication service  between 2 or more people. Using an instant messaging service you can send  private messages to a single individual. However its real advantage is in using  the service for group communications. Here groups can communicate effectively  and typically use their phone to access messages. On a work experience  placement with Accenture group chats in a WhatsApp group was very positive for  communicating. Chat was less formal and it was an easy way to communicate.  Snapchat is another popular service, snapchat however only makes content  available for a short while and is less suitable to chats where re-checking  posts is desirable.</p>
			
        <h5>Instant Relay Chat </h5>
        <p>Is similar to the instant messaging services, however it is  generally used for much larger audiences wanting a greater level of detail and  ordering of chat. An online forum is a good example, where numerous users can  join, many of whom the user might never have known before. Discussion topics  can be assigned to specific threads and members are invited to share their  thoughts. On these platforms users can also send private messages and sometimes  threads can be limited to a few individuals to discuss matters by themselves. </p>
        
			<h5>Short Message Services </h5>
        <p>Originally designed to send a limited text message across a  global wireless network. Messages are relayed by a short message service centre  before arriving at their intended destination. Initially limited it has  expanded to a multimedia messaging services capable of transmitting audio,  images and video.</p>
			
		<h5>Wireless Communication </h5>
	<p>The increase in data processing speeds over  recent decades has seen the internet become a much more user-friendly space. Wireless  communication has seen the World Wide Web become an ever present feature of the  modern world.  Today people are largely  able to access the web in any place at any time. Data has become a relatively  cheap commodity and for many the only limitation on access is battery charge  &amp; time.</p>

		  <h4>Searching, Navigating <br> &amp; Enjoying the Web</h4><div class="sectionp1">Educational  purposes, E-commerce &amp; Social Media</div>
			
            <h5>Searching &amp; Navigating the Web </h5>
            <p>The web in its simplest form is explored through search  engines via browsers. Common browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox  &amp; Microsoft Edge. Though there are an increasing number of browsers and  search engines available to choose from today. <br><br>
              You can enter the URL of a particular destination you would like to visit, or  you can search and see what your search engine provides you in the results  page. The search engine is particularly useful in finding solutions to problems  or discovering articles or facts.
              The web essentially is a massive network that hosts files for you to explore  and enjoy. 3 main areas of interest &amp; use on the web are for: Educational  purposes, E-commerce &amp; Social Media.</p>
            <br>
			
			<h5>Enjoying the Web</h5>
             
              
				<p><span>Education</span> at its simplest level is learning about any topic  you like to explore. Applications like teams &amp; zoom are used to share files  and host classes online. These aspects ramped up during covid-19 lockdowns. At  more advanced levels, college students can use Google Scholar to search for  academic papers for research projects and theses. Similarly many bodies of  scientists use the web applications to share datasets and collaborate on  trans-continental studies.</p> <br><br>
              
			<p><span>E-commerce</span> refers to the conducting of commerce online. It  can see people banking online with their applications, transferring funds or checking  their balances. E-commerce can see people use government services and for  example pay their car tax online. E-commerce also applies to advertising across  various platforms or providing services via their own website. Consumers are  able to explore large catalogues on Amazon or EBay, and the adapting of  business to the online world sees more and more people shopping online. </p><br><br>
            
		<p><span>Social Media</span>
           Social media for many is a way to connect with their friends  &amp; family online, whilst also allowing them to connect with much larger  audiences across the world.
              YouTube, Facebook &amp; Twitter are 4 of the more prominent social media sites.  
				
				<br>YouTube deals mostly in video content of varying lengths from the shorts mimicking  TikTok, to the long form podcasts varying from 20 minutes to several hours. <br>
				
              YouTube videos can be shared on Facebook, however this social media site has an  ability to connect local communities in a far greater way and global ones too.  While YouTube is mostly about the content creators, Facebook is more about the  user base. People share their own content more regularly here and interaction  is more driven from its user base.  <br>
              Twitter is a more tumultuous platform though it has a smaller user base. It is  the platform of choice for journalists &amp; politicians. Current affairs,  Political messaging &amp; activism dominate this sphere.  </p><br>
