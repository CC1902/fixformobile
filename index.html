		<p><span>My Design</span><br><br>

			My design would start on a black body. This would only be visible on the margins to a small degree.<br>
			I prefer my content to be accessible with slightly larger than normal font sizes. I also like my pages to have a Capital I shape as I find this format to be less cluttered. <br>
<br>
I structured my pages to have curved corners. Starting with my header where I used my own h3 header.
Below this I positioned my navigation bar. <br><br>

Then my main content section featured and styled to each page's needs, whilst trying to keep a familiarity between pages. 
I started each main with my own h7 styled title from the page and thereafter used mainly sections or a table for input data. <br><br>

My footer enjoyed some artistic license, with a background set to portray some of the drawbacks of the internet - rage and ugliness. 
I would use a table with my 'Produced by ConorC' text &amp; Blue icon drawing I created. This table was set with a transparent background so the image beneath could shine. I used a new colour scheme for this text white with black shadow. 
			<br><br>

			Overall i would use black, blues, aqua, aliceblue &amp; a pale yellow as my colour scheme to display my pages. 
I used a style sheet as the basis for my CSS, imported from a previous page and I adapted CSS for individual pages. I used unordered lists in several places to break up larger sections of text. Four  images, 2 ARPAnet maps &amp; 2 screenshots of Dreamweaver had links added to  them – so that they could be viewed in a new tab at greater scale for clarity. <br><br> I was reasonably happy with my efforts, though the internet and its complexity can be very overwhelming as a topic for discussion.</p>
