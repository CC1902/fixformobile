		  <h4>Customer Relation Management (CRM)</h4><br>
			
          <p>Customer relations management refers to strategies &amp;  software that enables an organisation to maximise its customer relations.  <br><br>
            In its simplest form CRM might entail a simple reply to a  received e-mail, acknowledging the receipt of said email and a brief reply  about when the sender might expect a significant reply. <br>
            On forums or social media it might be a notification to inform the user of a  reply to their posts/content.<br><br>
            It might entail a consumer being able to schedule a call  back from an agent at a suitable time, a customer relations agent having a live  chat, access to accounts or records to assist sales agents or customer  relations staff. FAQ sections can direct the client to answers to the most  common queries. <br><br>
			  
            CRM might monitor and assign sales agents so that 2 agents  are not contacting the same target, or automate sales processes to meet consumer&rsquo;s  needs. It might access which advertising campaigns are most effective with  clients and assign personalised content to each users preferences. CRM can also  manage data safely, or protect data by automatically backing up data to cloud  services.<br><br>
            At higher levels it is typically associated with data  management and analysis driving productivity and efficiency. Including AI  suggestions based on previous data to drive growth, profits, brand recognition  and reputation. <br><br>
            Some of the leading CRM solutions are provided by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Microsoft-Dynamics</li>
            <li>Zoho CRM</li>
            <li>Oracle CX</li>
            <li>Sage CRM </li>
            <li>Salesforce</li>

		  <h4>Payments Systems</h4>
          <br>

          <p>Payment systems are a vital part of a business&rsquo;s planning. It  permits the secure and speedy receipt of income from sales, and similarly in  paying debts. With the advent of the World Wide Web e-commerce has boomed to become  a significant share of numerous businesses planning. <br><br>
			  
			  In the US around 2011, e-commerce had grown to account for  about 5% of retail sales. By 2020 this had peaked to 15% in part due to the  pandemic. However, as the lockdown era has declined e-commerce still accounts  for rough 13-14% of retail sales.<br><br>

Below we can see a graph that shows the growth in online  retail sales for several nations from 2012 compared with 2019, and this trend  has been seen across the globe. </p><br>

          <p>  Completing transactions online is an important aspect for a business to consider. By providing multiple means of completing transactions a business can remove barriers for customers in completing transactions. <br><br>            
            There are many providers to choose from and each has its own costs and benefits, again employing each one as part of your business plan reduces barriers for transactions to be completed. 
  <br><br>
            You can setup an internet merchant account via your bank to process credit card payments on your own site. Third party providers include Merchant Accounts, Beanstream and InternetSecure. These services require an internet gateway service to verify information, transfer requests and authorise credit card payments. 
  <br><br>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>PayPal their online services permit credit card  payments and bank transfer purchases. PayPal charges a percentage fee  (1.9%-2.9%) and a standard fee (30 US cent) on each transaction. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Square in addition to PayPal&rsquo;s services can also  provide its clients with a card reader for accepting payments in person. Their  fees are 2.75% of every transaction. Square also provides an online store site  where items or services can be listed and purchased. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Stripe offers a service where you embed their  form on your own site. It works across multiple devices and they charge 2.9% of  the total transaction and 30 cent fee on each transaction. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Amazon&rsquo;s checkout service is again similar and  also charge 2.9% of the total transaction and 30 cent fee on each transaction.  This fee can reduce as sales increase above $3,000 a month. Amazon requires  your client to setup an Amazon account and you are provided with their details  thereafter: name, email &amp; postal details. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Sum up is a good alternative for tech adverse  smaller retailers. This app pair your phone with a card reader and you simply  enter the amount to be charged and the payment processor debits and credits  accounts. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Crypto-currency trading is another option,  however, this is a relatively niche market and requires a tech savvy capacity  to implement safely and securely. </li>
          </ul>
          <p> <br>
            Whilst there are numerous options to choose from, there are many people who feel uncomfortable trading online and as such you should still take advantage of potential viewers and facilitate their ability to trade with you. This can be as simple as providing an application form or referring them to larger stores that might stock your items. Finally having selected you payment processing portfolio, make sure to account for these costs in your pricing structure.

		  <h4><a name="_Toc98707000">Supply Chain Management</a></h4><br>
          <blockquote> &ldquo;Supply chain management is the management of the flow of  goods and services and includes all processes that transform raw materials into  final products.&nbsp;It involves the active streamlining of a business's  supply-side activities to maximize customer value and gain a competitive  advantage in the marketplace.&rdquo; (Fernando, 2022)</blockquote>
<br>
          <p>  Effective supply chain management minimises costs, waste and  time in delivering products from raw materials to consumers. Traditionally this  system consists of 5 elements: Planning, Sourcing, Manufacturing, Delivery  &amp; Returns.  <br><br>
          <ul>
             <li>Planning to acquire all resources and stages  required to meet customer demand. Defining metrics to gauge the success and  efficiency of meeting company and consumer goals. </li>
             <li>Sourcing all goods &amp; services to create the  product lines, or services. Managing the chain of orders, receipts, inventory  and releasing payments. Improving relationships with suppliers is also a  desirable outcome. </li>
             <li>Manufacturing requires organisation of raw  materials, storage &amp; production. Quality assurance is provided by monitoring  and testing during the manufacturing phase. </li>
             <li>Delivery, coordinating the flow of incoming  orders and other documentation to ensure the reliable delivery of goods or  services in a timely order. </li>
			  <li> Returns, a system to receive returned goods  whether defective or unwanted and the impact on inventory as a result.</li>
			</ul></p>
              <br>
    
         <p> Effective advanced SCM uses data and trend analysis to identify  potential problems, such as avoiding disappointing customers by anticipating  stock shortages or surges in demand. Adjusting prices to reduce losses with  seasonal or expiration dates as result of data analysis. Where products are  produced on ordering goods, data analysis through SCM can provide precise  details for completion of manufactured goods and delivery times. <br><br>
          Good supply chain management can be effective in pleasing consumers who are  able to order goods and receive quality products on time. This improves  customer satisfaction with the organisation and reduces bad exposure through potential poor quality goods or late  deliveries. </p>
