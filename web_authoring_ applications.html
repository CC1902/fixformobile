	  <h4>Web Authoring for Personal, <br>
 or Small  Enterprise Scale</h4><br>

		  <p> With applications such as Notepad++ one can easily begin to  code webpages, using your web-browser to then see what you have published. Combining  this freeware source code editor, and your browser, you can use sites like w3schools.com  to produce web pages like the one below.</p><br>
			  <img src="images/notepad.png" width="80%" alt="Notepad creation"><br><br>


       <p>Proper web authoring applications can assist in reducing  this stress by providing a live split view of code and a preview of the web  page. Applications such as Adobe Dreamweaver provide this service, and they can  identify coding errors and prompt solutions. This feature can help as otherwise  you must scroll through code to find errors.</p> <br>

<blockquote>  &ldquo;Web authoring is the  practice of creating web documents using modern web authoring software and  tools. Web authoring software is a type of desktop publishing tool that allows  users to navigate the tricky environment of HTML and web coding by offering a  different kind of graphical user interface.&rdquo; (Techopedia, 2022)</blockquote><br>

         <p> Similarly, Dreamweaver provides prompts on which features  are available after selecting a primary feature. In the first column of the table  below, the application highlights in red that there is an issue with this line  of code. Its initial prompt is one stating I&rsquo;m missing a special character – namely  the closing quotation mark on my image file type .png – which I can remedy. It  then instructs me  to apply an alt tag  naming the image alt=&ldquo;small-logo&rdquo;.</p><br>

        <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
          <tr>
            <td width="282" valign="top">
					<a href="images/errorb.png" target="_blank">
						<img src="images/error.png" width="90%"  alt="Error spotting">
              </a>
              </td>
            <td width="282" valign="top">
			<a href="images/solvedb.png" target="_blank">
				<img src="images/solved.png" width="90%" alt="Error solved"></a>
			</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
			
        <p>Searching large sections of code for an error manually is  frustrating, similarly notepad++ does not pick up missing alt tags for example.  Web authoring applications like Adobe&rsquo;s Dreamweaver reduce this need and  stress. Adobe&rsquo;s suite  has other complientary applications like Adobe XD where you can design a  webpage adding layers and exporing the suitability of Font-size for example in  fitting into your navigation.<br><br>
          Other  web authoring application providers include Wix, Wordpress, Webflow, Corel  Website Creator &amp; Xara Web Designer.</p>

		  <h4>Content  Management Systems (CMS)</h4><br>

          <p> On a smaller scale  as outlined above a person might manage a small website that remains relatively  static. However on bigger projects that change or are updated routinely, or  where many people need to be able to add or edit webpages a content managements  system is preferable. </p><br>
			   
			     <blockquote>&ldquo;A Content Management System is a software  application used to create and design web content online. It allows the users  to manage the digital content easily by providing access to features like  database handling, smart reporting, archiving, designing and animation features.  These are generally used in Enterprise Content Management (ECM) and Web Content  Management (WCM)&rdquo; (Bansal, 2021)</blockquote><br>

            <p>In a large business  or in a community forum, you might want web users to have varying degrees of  access to modify pages. The main format of webpages might be under the control  of a select few. A CMS facilitates varying degrees of authorised access <br><br>
			Individuals with higher authority levels like a moderator  could remove inappropriate content, or alter aspects of the webpage like  navigation, colour scheme, layout etc. However, many people might want to be  able to publish or modify posts and with a lesser administrative status. <br><br>
			   
            A journalist might want to add a story, or a forum member create a thread.  Without having the relevant skills to complete these tasks on their own, a  content management system permits these people to complete their goals.<br><br>

			 A CMS  might permit a forum member to create a post by entering their message. Or create a thread with their thread title, their post with common features like  formatting text or adding multimedia content in a streamlined process. <br><br>
			   CMS processes are  typically refined to 2 core aspects:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A  content management application (CMA)&nbsp;– This aspect dependent on authorisation level allows you to add  and manage your content on the website.</li>
            <li>A  content delivery application (CDA)&nbsp;– This aspect relates to the processing of the data you input in  the CMA: storing it appropriately and making it accessible to would be  site/page visitors. </li>
          </ul>
			<br>
            <p>In this regard many  people can be adding value to a website, creating new pages, threads or  stories. Many of the technical aspects are automated for their ease, and in  protecting the website from crashes due to wild coding attempts. <br><br>

			Articles or threads can retain a greater consistency in their visual format, layout and colour scheme. Images, audio &amp; video files can  be easily added to libraries automatically, stored and retrieved efficiently for the sites visitors to enjoy.
			</p>
			<br>

			<p>There are many providers in the market such as: Joomla, Drupal,  Squarespace, Kinsta, WordPress, Shopify, Adobe Experience Manager Sites &amp;  Mambo. With many applications in addition to those outlined earlier: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Multilingual  CMS – translating pages &amp; communications to meet a global audience</li>
            <li>E-commerce  CMS – like Shopify users can edit and post new items in their stores</li>
            <li>Education  – providing online courses or materials with project submission and feedback features</li>
            <li>Booking  systems – for clients booking services, time slots and processing cancelations </li>
            <li>Inventory  &amp; Sales processing – monitoring stock levels &amp; printing labels for deliveries  or product packaging</li>
            <li>Web  Security &amp; Payment Processing – securing the site and payment processing</li>
          </ul>
